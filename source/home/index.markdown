This is Jinghao Shi. I am currently a first year Ph.D. student in [Department of Computer
Science and Engineering][cse], [University at Buffalo][ub].

I received my B.S. degree in 2011 on Computer Science at [University of Science and
Technology of China][ustc]. Then I came to [University of Hong Kong][hku]. I
spent one year and a half there, before I dropped my program and came to
Buffalo, due to personal reasons.

This site is generated using [Octopress][octopress], and hosted in [Github
Pages][github]. You can find more about [my projects][projects] and
[blogs][blog].
