This is Jinghao Shi [^1] (<img src="/images/name.png" width="60" height="20" 
alt="Chinese Name" style="vertical-align:middle; border:0px !important;" />). 
I am currently a second year Ph.D. student in 
[Department of Computer Science and Engineering][cse], [University at Buffalo][ub].

I received my B.S. degree in 2011 on Computer Science at 
[University of Science and Technology of China][ustc]. Then I came to 
[University of Hong Kong][hku]. I spent one year and a half there, before I 
dropped my program and came to Buffalo, due to personal reasons.
