The first concern of OS161 virtual memory system is how to manage physical
pages. Generally, we can pack a physical page's information into a structure
(called `struct coremap_entry`) and **use this struct to represent a physical page**. 
**We use an array of `struct coremap_entry` to keep all physical pages information.** 
This array, aka, **coremap**, will be one of the most important data structure in this lab.

### What should we store in coremap entry structure?

For each physical page, we want to know:

 - Where is this page mapped? (For swapping)
 - What's this pages status? (free, fixed, clean, dirty...)
 - Other info (e.g. need by paging algorithm)

So the definition of `struct coremap_entry` may look like this:

```
struct coremap_entry { 
    /* where is paged mapped to */
    struct addrspace* as; 
    vaddr_t va;

    /* page state */ 
    page_state_t state;

    /* other info for paging algorithm  */
};
```

A page can have for different states, as shown below.

This diagram is quite clear. Several points to note:

 - When a physical page is first allocated, its state is DIRTY, not CLEAN. Since this
 page do not have a copy in swap file (disk). Remember that in a virtual memory
 system, memory is just a cache of disk.

 - For some reason, we may want to always keep a certain page in memory, e.g.
    - kernel pages, since these pages are direct mapped.
    - user stack and code segment pages which we already knew will be frequently accessed. 

  So we have a special state called "fixed", means that **we'll never swap out these 
  pages to disk**.


### Coremap Initialization

We need to initiate our coremap in `vm_bootstrap`. First, we need to find out
how many physical pages in system. We can do this using `ram_getsize`. There
is a big trick here. Since we will only know the physical page number, i.e.
coremap array length at runtime, so we'd better just define a `struct coremap_entry`
pointer and allocate the actually array at runtime after we got the physical
page number, rather than use a statically defined array with some MACRO like
`MAX_PHY_PAGE_NUM`. So at first glance, we may write:

```c
paddr_t firstaddr, lastaddr; 
ram_getsize(&firstaddr, &lastaddr); 
total_page_num = ROUNDDOWN(lastaddr, PAGE_SIZE) / PAGE_SIZE; 
coremap =(struct coremap_entry*) kmalloc(total_page_num * sizeof(struct coremap_entry)); 
```

**But the above code will definitly fail**. 


Take a look at `ram_getsize`,
we can see that this function will destroy its `firstaddr` and `lastaddr`
before return. So after that, if we call `kmalloc`, which call `alloc_kpage`,
`get_ppages` and `ram_stealmem` to get memory, `ram_stealmem` will fail. The
contradiction is: **we need to call `ram_getsize` to get physical page number
so that we can allocate our coremap(`pages`), but once we call `ram_getsize` we
will not be able allocate any pages!**

To resolve this contradiction, on one hand, we should **initialize all other
data structures, e.g., locks, before we call `ram_getsize`**. Then we call
`ram_getsize` to get `firstaddr` and `lastaddr`. After that, instead of using
`kmalloc`, we must **allocate our coremap manually**, without invoking any
other malloc routines. A possible solution may be:

```c
paddr_t firstpaddr, lastpaddr;
ram_getsize(&firstaddr, &lastaddr); 
total_page_num = ROUNDDOWN(lastaddr, PAGE_SIZE) / PAGE_SIZE; 
/* pages should be a kernel virtual address !!  */
coremap = (struct coremap_entry*)PADDR_TO_KVADDR(firstaddr); 
freeaddr = firstaddr + page_num * sizeof(struct coremap_entry); 
```

Now we allocated our core map just between `firstaddr` and `freeaddr`, and
[`freeaddr`, `lastaddr`] will be system's free memory.

Then we initialize the coremap array, we need to mark any pages between [0,
`freeaddr`) as fixed, since this memory contains important kernel code and
data, or memory mapped I/Os. And we just mark pages between [`freeaddr`,
`astaddr`] as free.

At the end of `vm_bootstrap`, we may want to **set some flags to indicate that
vm has already bootstrapped,** since functions like `alloc_kpages` may call
different routines to get physical page before and after `vm_bootstrap`.
