## Research

#### PhoneLab

[PhoneLab][phonelab] is a smart phone testbed operated at UB. Current we have 288
participants using the phone ([Galaxy Nexus][gn]) we provided as their primary 
phone.

I'm currently the maintainer of the [Conductor][conductor] app, which is
responsible for:

 - Collect logs from device
 - Upload logs to our backend server
 - Perform Platform OTA update
 - And a lot more!

#### Smart Phone Assisted Wifi AP Configuration

IEEE 802.11 WLAN, commonly known as WiFi, only has [three non-overlapping
channels at 2.4GHz band][wiki]. This causes severe channel collision and
interference problems, especially in environment with dense Access Point (AP)
deployment.
