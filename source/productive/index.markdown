This is a collection of tools that make me more productive, and my life much easier.
Or as I would say to my friends: "They are life-changing!"

### [Vim][vim]

I don't know about Emacs, but other than that, Vim is THE only editor you should
use! Here is my [.vimrc][vimrc].

### [Vimium][vimium]

Browse the web in a Vim way. A must-have for Vim addicts, like me, LOL~

### [Tmux][tmux]

If you ever need to login another machine to do some stuff, then you'll need
tmux. What? [screen][screen]? [Is it even designed for human][tmux_over_screen]?

Here is my [.tmux.conf][tmuxrc].

### [Dropbox][dropbox]

A must-have you have more then one computing device, by which I mean laptops,
desktops, smart phones, tablets, and so on. It just makes file syncing so smooth
and so painless.

### [LaTeX][latex]

I love typesetting using LaTeX. For a long time, it's been the reason that I
always finish my homework and project reports early.

### [Python][python]

{% blockquote Bruce Eckel %}
Life is short
(You need Python)
{% endblockquote %}

### Mechanical Keyboard

Trust me, you'll never want to use any membrane keyboards once you used to
the mechanical ones. They just makes you loving typing!

[How to Choose the Best Mechanical Keyboard (and Why You'd Want To)][link]

I'm currently using [Ducky 1008][ducky] at home and 
[CoolerMaster QuickFire Rapid][quickfire] at office. Both of them have brown
switches, yet feels slightly different.

I used to have a [Razer Black Widow 2013][razer] for two month, before it heated
up and died. That will be the last Razer product I'll ever have.
